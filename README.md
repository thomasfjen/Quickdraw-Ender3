# Quickdraw-Ender3
Quickdraw Probe Dock for Ender 3 with Parts from Quickdraw (for Switchwire) by hymness1

Voron Stealthburner/Afterburner Toolhead needed. The Quickdraw probe works only with the original carriage with MGN12 and space behind the nozzle for a probe.

I used this carriage: https://www.printables.com/model/135563-vrn-10s-pro-mod-for-cr-10s-pro-with-voron-stealthb

Based on: https://github.com/hymness1/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/hymness1/Quickdraw_probe_Voron_Switchwire

Because of the linear rail and carriage i lost a good amount of y-travel. I regained all the travel by moving the y-extrusion forward by replacing the original m5 screws with shorter ones and t-nuts in the rail.
